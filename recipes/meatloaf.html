    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Chuck</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Worcestershire Sauce</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Bread Crumbs</li>
        <li>Glaze</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking dish with lightly greased foil.</li>
        <li>Place carrot, celery, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic in a food processor; pulse until 
            very finely chopped, almost to a pur√©e. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add ground chuck to the vegetables, along with Worcestershire sauce, egg, Italian herbs, salt, 
            black pepper, and cayenne. Mix gently with a wooden spoon until ingredients are just combined. 
            Sprinkle in bread crumbs and gently mix with your fingertips until just combined; don't overmix.</li>
        <li>Shape the mixture into a loaf, about 4 inches high by 6 inches across. Place in the prepared baking pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until the meatloaf is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon, and Sriracha for glaze in a small bowl until brown sugar has dissolved.</li>
        <li>Remove meatloaf from the oven. Spoon glaze on the top of the meatloaf with the back of a spoon, then pull a tiny bit glaze down the sides.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven, and bake until no longer pink inside, 45 to 75 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest 
            part of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), so start checking at 45 minutes and continue baking until meatloaf reaches that temperature. 
            Cooking time will depend on shape and thickness of the meatloaf.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
